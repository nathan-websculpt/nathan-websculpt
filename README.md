### I am currently passionate about protecting text from tyranny and disaster in decentralized and distributed ways

#### So what if you and your company do good? Someone else will run it one day. Someone you have yet to meet and therefore - can never trust. We need decentralization...

#### While I have stored The Gospel of John directly onto the blockchain, I do not think it is enough. I've worked towards allowing a council to oversee the process, but even still ... I'm itching for a Rust build for this sort of goal ðŸ˜Š
